Module 4 README: Linux SysAdmin Fundamentals

Module Description
This module introduces Linux operating systems and the basics of IT system administration. A strong knowledge of Linux is essential for many technical cybersecurity roles. Most computers that security professionals interact with are Linux computers, and much of their work involves configuring and networking them securely.
This module will prepare you for system administration roles by covering the foundational knowledge of users, groups, permissions, and access controls.

Module 4: Challenge Assignment
This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.

In this week's Challenge assignment, students will prepare a Linux server for use by a fictional organization.

Looking Forward

Next week, we will build on Linux sysadmin fundamentals by using Linux tools to archive and restore data.

These practices are used to maintain data availability and protect against natural disasters and cyberattacks. We will also learn how to schedule data backups on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis and monitor log files to prevent and detect suspicious activity.
